# Contacts App
## Project Proposal
The Contacts App is a web-based application that allows users to manage and organize their contact information. With the Contacts App, users can:
* Add, edit, and delete contact records
* Search and filter their contacts list
* Create groups of contacts and send messages or emails to the entire group at once
* Sync their contact information with other apps and devices
* Import and export their contacts list
* Add custom fields to their contact records
<br />

## Road Map
The following is a high-level road map for the development of the Contacts App:
* Set up the backend:
  * Install and configure MongoDB
  * Set up a Node.js server using Express
  * Define routes for different actions (e.g. adding a new contact, retrieving a list of contacts, updating a contact)
  * Create a RESTful API for accessing the contact information stored in the MongoDB database
* Test and deploy the app:
    * Test the API locally to make sure it is working as expected
    * Deploy the API to a hosting platform such as Heroku or AWS
* Ongoing development:
    * Add authentication and authorization to protect the privacy of users' contact information
    * Implement error handling to ensure a smooth user experience
    * Optimize performance and scalability as needed
##Getting Started
