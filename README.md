# Contacts App

## Project Proposal

The Contacts App is a web-based application that allows users to manage and organize their contact information. With the Contacts App, users can:

- Add, edit, and delete contact records
- Search and filter their contacts list
- Create groups of contacts and send messages or emails to the entire group at once
- Sync their contact information with other apps and devices
- Import and export their contacts list
- Add custom fields to their contact records

The Contacts App will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The app will be deployed to a hosting platform such as Heroku or AWS.

This wireframe shows the main pages and screens of the app, including the contact list, a form for adding new contacts, and a form for editing existing contacts. It also shows some of the key features of the app, such as the ability to search and filter the contact list, create groups of contacts, and sync with other apps and devices

## Road Map

The following is a high-level road map for the development of the Contacts App:

- Set up the backend:
  - Install and configure MongoDB
  - Set up a Node.js server using Express
  - Define routes for different actions (e.g. adding a new contact, retrieving a list of contacts, updating a contact)
  - Create a RESTful API for accessing the contact information stored in the MongoDB database
- Set up the frontend:
    - Install and configure React
    - Create components for displaying the contact list, adding new contacts, and editing existing contacts
    - Handle user interactions and make API calls to the backend server
- Test and deploy the app:
    - Test the app locally to make sure it is working as expected
    - Deploy the app to a hosting platform such as Heroku or AWS
- Ongoing development:
    - Add authentication and authorization to protect the privacy of users' contact information
    - Implement error handling to ensure a smooth user experience
    - Optimize performance and scalability as needed
